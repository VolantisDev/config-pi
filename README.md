# Pi Config

> Configuration of your Raspberry Pi (or similar SoC) in a simple and beautiful web interface!

You are probably used to plugging in your Raspberry Pi to your network and configuring it as one of your first steps. Alternatively, you might have a pre-built SD card image (or a bunch of them) that has your settings preconfigured but always need to be updated after you get up and running.

Pi Config is an alternative to the existing norm. It allows things such as:

- Configure all of the important parts of your Pi directly from a beautiful web interface
- Automatic captive Wifi configuration so you never have to wire your Pi to your network
- A plugin system so anyone can easily extend Pi Config
- Custom UPnP port assignments
- Much more!

## Development

If you wish to contribute to Pi Config's development, here are some helpful commands:

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
